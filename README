Status as at 2010-01-25:

It's early days; currently this will give you a web-based GUI with
a display roughly analagous to crm_mon, in terms of status of cluster
resources.  It will show you running/dead/standby nodes, and the
resources (clones, groups & primitives) running on those nodes.

It does not yet provide information about failed resources/nodes,
other than the fact that they are not running.

Display of nodes & resources is collapsible (collapsed by default),
but if something breaks while you are looking at it, the display will
expand to show the broken nodes and/or resources.

Hawk is intended to run on each node in your cluster.  You can then
access it by pointing your web browser at the IP address of any
cluster node, or the address of any IPaddr(2) resource you may have
configured.

Minimally, to see it in action, you will need the following packages
and their dependencies (names per openSUSE/SLES):

  - ruby
  - rubygem-rails-2_3
  - rubygem-gettext_rails

Once you've got those installed, run the following command:

  # hawk/script/server

Then, point your browser at http://your-server:3000/ to see the
status of your cluster.

Ultimately, hawk is intended to be installed and run as a regular
system service via /etc/init.d/hawk.  To do this, you will need
the following additional packages:

  - lighttpd
  - ruby-fcgi
  - rubygem-rake

Then, try the following, but READ THE MAKEFILE FIRST!  "make install"
(and the rest of the build system for that matter) is frightfully
primitive at the moment:

  # make
  # sudo make install
  # /etc/init.d/hawk start

Then, point your browser at http://your-server:4444/ to see the
status of your cluster.

Good luck.  Please direct comments, feedback, questions, etc. to
tserong@novell.com and/or the Pacemaker mailing list.
