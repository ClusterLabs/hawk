* to be accessed from tools menu, switch to dashboard mode
  * strictly dashboard shouldn't require login, but each cluster within it does
  * should be done all client-side, so in principle could offer the dashboard
    for download and be run as files off local workstation.  Login credentials
    saved in local store?  (security issue?)
    
== Workflow ==

* Add cluster to dashboard
  * Name it
  * Enter hostname of at least one node
  * UI connects (requires login!) gets status and list of other nodes
  * Cluster appears in dashboard
* On first run, can add current cluster automatically (still needs name)
* Each cluster must be monitored (does long poll work?  one outstanding req
  per cluster?)
  * Should be fine - there can at least be many inflight calls to monitor
    (actual cib reading is going to suck a bit on the slower pcmk 1.1.8 if
    people are viewing the clusters too :-/)  
  * Need to retain list of all nodes so if polled node fails can try another
* Cluster set saved in long-lived cookie.  Too big?  Local storage?
  * Note: tied to whichever node you're accessing the cluster from; suggests
    running hawk on some other non-cluser node just to access the dashboard...

* Basically want a cut-back of the summary view, i.e.:

  +------------------------+
  | CLUSTER NAME           |
  |                        |
  | n Nodes Configured     |
  |                        |
  |   Online:  n           |
  |                        |
  | n Resources Configured |
  |                        |
  |   Started: n           |
  +------------------------+
  
Given we have to change the server side anyway in order to get cross-site AJAX
to work, we have the option of adding a cib "mini" view which only returns those
counters (plus the epoch etc. necessary for the long poll).

* Someting like

== On Security ==

* Having to be logged in to each cluster is a complete and total nightmare.
  You'd need a current login on _every_node_ in _every_cluster_ in order for
  it to work reliably (say the node being polled dies, and we have to
  automatically poll another node...)

* If we allow cib access without login we need to at least get:
  - count of nodes by state
  - total node count (can be inferred from above)
  - count of resources by state
  - total resource count (can be inferred from above)
  - as above for tickets
  - list of nodes in cluster (so we can find other nodes to poll)

* What does this mean for security?
  - if you know one hostname, you know all the hostnames
  - you can get some idea of cluster state
  - is this a problem?

* Mitigation:
  - hosts.allow?
  - store username and password for a cluster, then use it automatically
    when accessing any node with permission denied to trigger setup of the
    session cookie
    - that would (should) actually work, except that it means storing the
      users credentials potentially insecurely in browser local store
