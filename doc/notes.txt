Random Notes
============

== Components / Commit Messages ==

As seen in commit messages, there's four broad classifications:

* GUI: generally anything you can actually see in the web browser.
* Build: build infrastructure etc.
* Doc: documentation, generally internal/developer (so far).
* Misc: anything else.  This includes changes to models where no
  GUI visible changes are made.

Within that, we generally narrow it down a bit, e.g.:

* GUI: explorer: (not "history", despite a handful of commit messages
  to the contrary)
* GUI: simulator: 
* GUI: wizard:
* GUI: summary_view:
* GUI: ui.location:
* etc.

This categorization is somewhat arbitrary, but tends to be either
functional area for larger changes or component/file name for
smaller changes.

== Hacking ==

=== @attributes in CibObject subclasses ===

See e.g.: clone.rb.  Set @attributes in your subclass to the list
of attributes you want users to be able to edit.  Anything in that
list is subject to mass assignment via CibObject::set_attributes.
Nothing outside that list will be set by mass assignment.

=== New MVC (e.g.: for Constraints) ===

----------------------------------------
# script/generate controller Constraints
# vim app/models/constraint.rb
# vim test/unit/constraint_test.rb
----------------------------------------

== Known Issues ==

If a host is accessible via both shortname and FQDN (e.g.: as on a local
network) and you're using Internet Explorer, and connect via
https://shortname:7630/, you may see a Security Warning something like:

____
This webpage contains content that will not be delivered using a 
secure HTTPS connection, which could compromise the security of the
entire webpage.
____

This seems to be beacuse IE thinks Hawk's AJAX requests are some sort
of XSS exploit (see answer to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6290149/how-to-overcome-this-security-issue).

Workaround: always access Hawk via https://FQDN:7630/
