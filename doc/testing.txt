Testing Hawk
============
Tim Serong <tserong@suse.com>

== Introduction

Following is a series of manual test plans to verify that Hawk's basic
functionality behaves as expected.  These should be run on a variety
of web browsers, but at a minimum at least:

* Firefox 3
* Internet Explorer 7

It would be best to also run these on:

* Google Chrome
* Safari
* Konqueror 

Once basic functionality has been verified, more specific tests (e.g.:
correct behaviour for ACLs, testing for specific error messages from
underlying tools, etc.) can generally be performed in the browser of
your choice.

Note that one should always be on the lookout for weird display
artifacts at every step, even though this is not explicitly stated
in any of the tests.

== Tests for Basic Functionality

=== Login/Logout

. Go to https://SERVER:7630/
. Hit "Log In", verify it fails with "Username not specified" and
  "Password not specified" if those fields are empty.
. Verify login fails when invalid username/password entered.
. Verify login succeeds as "hacluster", and you're redirected to
  the main status page.
. Verify "logout" takes you back to the login page.
. Verify https://SERVER:7630/main/status redirects you to the
  login page.
. Verify https://SERVER:7630/cib/live/crm_config/cib-bootstrap-options/edit
  redirects you to the login page.
. Log in as "hacluster", then right-click the logout link to open
  it in a new tab.  Try to perform some operation (e.g.: put a node
  on standby), verify you get a "Permission denied" error.
. While still looking at the (now invalid) status page, ssh to the
  cluster node and stop a resource, or do something to change the
  cluster state - in your web browser, you should be immediately
  bounced back to the login page with the message "you have been
  logged out".

=== Cluster Status Display

. Log in as "hacluster" and go to
  https://SERVER:7630/main/status?cib_file=all-resource-types.xml
. Verify all three panels are expandable, and all clone/group children
  are expandable.
. Verify both nodes show online, and all resources show started.
  The Promotable resource should be promoted on one node.
. Go to https://SERVER:7630/main/status?cib_file=all-resource-types-demoted.xml
  and verify both instances of the Promotable resources are promotable resources.
. Go to https://SERVER:7630/main/status?cib_file=all-resource-types-failed-child.xml
  and verify the resource panel expands automatically to show the
  non-running filesys resource, and there is a Failed op reported
  at the top of the screen.
. Return to https://SERVER:7630/main/status, then ssh to the cluster
  node and stop the cluster.  The status display should show everything
  stopping, then ultimately say "Connection to cluster failed".
. Start the cluster again, within 15 seconds the status display
  should come up again.
  
=== Basic Management Operations

_Note_: This requires a cluster with at least two nodes, a single
primitive, a group, a clone, a promotable set, and working STONITH.
We assume everything is running at the start of this test.

. Log in as "hacluster".
. Put one node on standby.  Resource panel should expand to show
  stopped resources, and node should go into Standby mode.
. Bring node online again, resources should start again, and all
  should show green.
. Fence one node, it should show OFFLINE and all resources should
  stop as in the standby test.  When it comes back online, everything
  should go green again.
. Stop a primitive resource, it should show as stopped.
. Start the resource again, it should show as started.
. Move the resource to the other node, verify it moves.
. Drop the relocation rule for that resource, use "crm configure show"
  on the node to verify the location rule is gone.
. Fail a resource (e.g.: "crm_resource -F -r d0 -N node-0", verify a
  failed op appears.  Cleanup the resource using Hawk, verify the failed
  op disappears.
. Verify children of the group can be started and stopped, but the
  Move and Drop Relocation Rule ops are not available.
. Demote the promotable set, verify all instances are promotable resources.
. Promote the promotable set, verify one instance becomes promoted.
. Verify the instances of the promotable set and clone don't have
  op menus.

=== Cluster Configuration Editor

. Log in as "hacluster".
. Click the properties icon in the Configuration panel to get to
  the configuration editor.
. Click in each text field, verify that Help text appears.
. Remove a couple of properties, verify that they now appear in
  the "add new property" drop-down list (where they didn't before).
. Add a couple of properties, verify that they no longer appear in
  the "add new property" drop-down list. 
. Click "Revert Changes", verify proeprties are back how they were
  originally.
. Remove one property, change one property and add one property
  (or some variation thereof).  Click "Apply Changes", verify
  properties are changed.
. Click "Back", you should be back at the cluster status page.

== Tests for ACL Support

_Note_: You should use the same cluster as for the Basic Functionality
Basic Management Operations tests, but will need to enable ACL support
and have three users (in the "haclient" group) as follows:

. "alice", with no ACLs defined.
. "bob", with a "read" ACL for the entire cluster.
. "carol", with a "write" ACL for the entire cluster.

=== Login/Logout

. Log in as "alice".  Login should proceed, then you should be bounced
  back to the login page with a permission denied error.
. Log in as "bob".  You should land on the status page as usual.
. Log in as "carol".  You should land on the status page as usual.

=== Basic Management Operations

. Log in as "bob".  Try to put a node on standby.  You should see a
  permission denied error.  Likewise for each of the other node and
  resource ops.  As at 2011-01-21, in some cases the op may silently
  fail (e.g.: node fence).  Just so long as it doesn't _succed_
  we're good.  TODO: flesh this out.
. Log in as "carol".  Try the various management ops.  They should all
  succeed as in Basic Functionality tests.

=== Cluster Configuration Editor

. Log in as "bob".  Try to edit the cluster configuration.  You should
  get a permission denied error when applying the changes (or if it
  says it succeeded due to shell return code being wrong, at least
  no changes should have been made.
. Log in as "carol".  Try to edit the cluster configuration.  This
  should succeed as in the Basic Functionality tests.
