# Note: When using Bundler (i.e. on SLES), the Gemfile is used.
# Anywhere else, we don't package the Gemfile, so need to require
# rails, fast_gettext, etc. in config/boot.rb, i.e. if we add more
# gems here, they need to go in config/boot.rb as well. Yes, this
# sucks, but it's the least-worst solution I can find right now for
# making Bundler go away when we neither need nor want it.
#
# Have I mentioned lately that while Bundler may be "the best way to
# manage a Ruby application's gems", it's an absolute menace if you're
# trying to build packaged software?
