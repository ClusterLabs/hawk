WAIT SPINNERS

  Wait spinner icons generated at http://www.ajaxload.info/

    Indicator Type:          Roller
    Background Color:        Various, see below
    Transparent Background:  No (but doesn't matter either way)
    Foreground Color:        #000000

  Spinner filenames are in the form:

    spinner-(res)-(state).gif

  There are five possible node/resource states, giving, by default:

    spinner-16x16-active.gif
    spinner-16x16-inactive.gif
    spinner-16x16-error.gif
    spinner-16x16-transient.gif
    spinner-16x16-neutral.gif

  Meanings of states and default colors are:

    active:     node/resource online/started (green, #6c6)
    inactive:   node/resource intentionally offline/stopped (grey, #ccc)
    error:      node/resource unintentionally offline/stopped (red, #c66)
    transient:  node/resource changing state (yellow, #fc6)
    neutral:    only used for groups/clones, (white, #fff)

  The "neutral" state really shouldn't be there - the group/clone
  should reflect the state of its children, so there will eventually
  be no need for this...


MENU ICONS

  Default set is taken from the gnome-icon-theme package 16x16 icons.
